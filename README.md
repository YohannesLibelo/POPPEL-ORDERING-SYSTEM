# Poppel Order Management System

## Introduction
Poppel is a manufacturer and importer of confectionery and soft drinks based in the Western Cape. With rapid growth in recent years, the company is seeking significant expansion. To accommodate this growth, Poppel aims to overhaul its current manual and labor-intensive internal systems. This document outlines the scope and context of the proposed system.

## Issues with Current System
- Orders are rejected if customers exceed their credit limit, resulting in loss of sales.
- Handwritten adjustments on picking lists lead to inaccurate delivery notes.
- Sales are often miscalculated or stolen, causing shortages or excess stock and loss of profits.

## Project Scope
The project aims to develop an Order Management System to streamline internal processes. Key functionalities include:

1. **User Authentication**: Users can log in to the system to manage orders.
2. **Membership Management**: Users can verify existing memberships or register new customers.
3. **Product Selection**: Users can select products from the inventory, view prices, and specify quantities.
4. **Order Modification**: Users can modify orders if products are unavailable.
5. **Credit Status Verification**: Users can verify the credit status of existing members.
6. **Payment Processing**: Users can capture payment details for members with unsatisfactory credit ratings.
7. **Picking List Generation**: The system generates picking lists for order fulfillment.
8. **Inventory Management**: Users can print reports to identify expired products in the inventory.
